<h2>Work this week</h2>
<h4>Reflection-based Serialization</h4>
<p>
  This week I completed the core work on this task. This entailed retrofitting every Message that the game sends, including 
  new ones that other team members had created while I was working on this new feature.
  It mostly involved deleting their manual serialization and deserialization code, and marking any
  members they did not want sent over the network with [NoNetSerialize], our new marker
  attribute which tells the serialization system not to include that member in the
  BinaryWriter. In addition, every Message must have a no-parameters Constructor which
  the reflection system uses to create the Message object before it fills in the values.
</p>
<p>
  With those changes, a Message now looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
public class EnemiesUpdateMessage : AbstractMessage
{

	// all these properties get seriaized automatically
    private int health;
    private Vector2 pos;
    private int id;
    private int currentPathPoint;
    private float currentPositionOnPath;

	// these properties will not be serialized because of the Attribute
    [NoNetSerialize]
    private EnemyData[] enemyDataList;

    [NoNetSerialize]
    private EnemiesObjStorage enemiesStorage;

    [NoNetSerialize]
    private EnemySpawner enemySpawner;
    
    // default constructor, used when the backend needs to create an inst 
    public EnemiesUpdateMessage()
    {
        // ... 
    }
    
     // Executor function. This gets called automatically when the message is received
    // by a client
    public override void Execute()
    {
    	// ...
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  This is much easier for our developers to understand. 
</p>

<h4>Fixing the hard-coded dictionary</h4>
<p>
  One other large pain-point with our networking backend is the need to manually maintain a
  large dictionary which contains every AbstractMessage, so that the backend can associate each
  one with a numeric ID. This is important because when one endpoint receives a buffer, it has no
  way of knowing what that buffer represents without that numeric ID in the first 4 bytes to
  inform it of the AbstractMessage type so that it can invoke the proper deserializer and then following codepaths.
</p>
<pre>
 public MessageSerializer() {
        // add each type of serializable here
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(DebugMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(GameSpeedUpdateMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(GlobalHealthMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(TowerUpdateMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(SetAutoStartMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(SellTowerMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(EnemiesUpdateMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(GamePauseMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(ValidatedRequest));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(StartWaveMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(EnemySpawnerUpdateMessage));
        serializables.AddSerializable(typeof(ChatMessage));
        
        // add more here ...
 }
</pre>
<p>
  Fortunatley for us, Reflection can help us here too. Instead of requiring programmers to
  manually add their types each time they add a new one, and then resolve merge conflicts
  when they try to merge their PRs, the backend can gather this information itself. I created a simple 
  ReflectionUtilities class to manage this:
</p>
<pre>
public static class ReflectionUtilities
{
    public static List&lt;Type&gt; GetTypesOfBaseType&lt;T&gt;()
    {
        return (from t in Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetTypes()
                where t.BaseType == typeof(T)
                select t).ToList();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
GetTypesOfBase&lt;T&gt; is a Generic function which, when the game initializes, uses a LINQ query to gather all types
in the codebase that derive from T. We can use then replace all of that AddSerializable nonsense with this: 
</p>
<pre>
var allSerializable = ReflectionUtilities.GetTypesOfBaseType&lt;AbstractMessage&gt;();

allSerializable.Sort((item1, item2) =>
{
	return string.Compare(item1.Name, item2.Name);
});

foreach (var type in allSerializable)
{
	serializables.AddSerializable(type);
}
</pre>
<p>
The sort is important. On different platforms, the order that the types come in may not be the same. However, the
Serializables datastructure uses insertion order to determine type IDs. We also can't use GetHashCode because its implementation
also varies across platforms. If the IDs for the same type did not match, then a Mac and a Windows player would not be
able to play in the same game. The sort rectifies this by using the type Names, which are stable across platforms, and orders
them alphabetcally. This ensures that the same IDs are generated for the same types across different platforms. I made sure to account
  for this because I encountered the same problem when creating RavEngine's networking system. RavEngine has a type ID system
  named CTTI which generates identifiers for types at compile time using compile-time string hashing of the type names. However, I discovered
  that type names were not compiler-stable, so I had to create a special system that used a lot of macro hacks to
  marshall type names into a consistent format across compilers. The experience building that made me wary of cross-platform
  differences which while DotNET is very good at hiding them, it does not hide everything, so one must be vigillant when using 
  more advanced features. 
</p>
<p>
  With the new system, programmers only need to create their AbstractMessage class, and it will automatically get registered
  with an ID, with all serialization and deserialization logic created for them, without needing to do anything!
</p>
<h4>New API for serializing types</h4>
One remaining wart we still had even with these improvements was the difficulty in defining how types should get serialized
and deserialized. In Ye Old Method before any of the reflection, each class would manually implement serialization for each
type that it wanted to send over the network, sometimes leading to duplicate serialization implementations of the same type. When
I added the automatic serializer, all of that code moved into a large switch statement inside of AbstractMessage:
<pre>
switch (field.FieldType)
{
    case var type when type == typeof(int):
        field.SetValue(this, reader.ReadInt32());
        break;
    case var type when type == typeof(bool):
        field.SetValue(this, reader.ReadBoolean());
        break;
    case var type when type == typeof(string):
        field.SetValue(this, reader.ReadString());
        break;
    case var type when type == typeof(float):
        field.SetValue(this, reader.ReadSingle());
        break;

	// etc...
}
</pre>
<p>
  While this had the benefit of including a single implementation of every type, it was difficult to work with
and would lead to merge conflicts when people wanted to add a new type to it. So I designed a new API which
resolved each of these problems.
</p>
<p>
  My goal for the new API was to enable programmers to insert a class marked with an attribute that contained
  the implementation of the serializer for the type they wanted to add, and that they could put that class
  wherever they wanted and the backend would be flexible enough to just handle it. I created a new marker attribute
  named [TypeSerializer] which can be applied to any class. Then I created a new class named SerializerLibrary
  which is responsible for loading all [TypeSerializer] classes and tracking what their purpose is. A TypeSerializer class
  is defined as follows:
</p>
<pre>
[TypeSerializer]
static class GuidSerializer
{
    public static void Serialize(BinaryWriter writer, Guid value)
    {
        writer.Write(value.ToByteArray());
    }
    public static Guid Deserialize(BinaryReader reader)
    {
        return new Guid(reader.ReadBytes(16));
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  The class must be static and have two public static member functions named Serialize and Deserialize. The first
  parameter of Serialize must be a BinaryWriter, and the second parameter is the type that the class will be processing.
  When the game initializes, it uses a new capability of ReflectionUtilities to gather all classes that
  have the [TypeSerializer] attribute. It then looks at the method signature of Serialize to pull the type of the
  second parameter, and stores the class and that type as related entries in a Dictionary. Then, when SerializerLibrary
  is asked to process a Field, it simply looks up in that dictionary what class it should use for that type,
  and then uses .Invoke() to call the related method with the parameter data. 
</p>
<p>
  With this design I accomplished all my design goals for the API. It is easy for programmers to use and involves
  no manual registration, the backend just takes care of it for them. It has the added benefit of grouping
  the serialization and deserialization code for a given type together so that it is easier to sanity-check. 
  Because programmers can place these classes anywhere, adding a new type does not lead to merge conflicts in AbstractMessage
  like in the past.
