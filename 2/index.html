<h2>Work this week</h2>
<p>
  My main task this week was to investigate and implement the upgrade to our message serialization system. Currently, to send a new message, one has to:
  <ol>
    <li>Subclass AbstractMessage</li>
    <li>Implement Serialize, which involves manually writing each field of the struct into the BinaryWriter</li>
    <li>Implement Deserialize, which involves manually reading each variable out of a Binary Reader and updating the struct's member fields</li>
    <li>Add an entry to the MessageSerializer class to register the new class with the system</li>
  </ol>
  If any of these items are not properly completed, the message will not work. In particular, steps 2-4 are tedious and error-prone. If a field is added but
Serialize and Deserialize are not updated to accomodate it in the correct order, the message will not behave properly and it can be difficult to debug.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunatley, C# has runtime reflection which we can use to solve this problem. Being a dynamic language, the code can inspect itself and even make 
  modifications while it is running. I created an initial design to leverage this as follows:
  <ul>
     <li>Create a new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/creating-custom-attributes">Attribute</a>
       [NetSerialize] which will inject the required code in at compile time</li>
    <li>Automatically implement Serialize by <a href="https://snipplr.com/view/18944/simple-enumeration-of-fields-of-a-struct-in-c-using-reflection">enumerating class
      member variables</a> and write them into the Serializer in order of declaration. If a developer does not want a field to be serialized, they can mark that field with the [NoNetSerialize] attribute</li>
     <li>Automatically implement Deserialize by doing the same as above but reading from the stream and setting the field data</li>
     <li>Interrogate the codebase at runtime to load all classes that are [NetSerialize] and automatically register them in MessageSerializer</li>
  </ul>
  With this design, steps 2-4 could be eliminated entirely, meaning developers only need to worry about what data they want to send rather than the minutiae 
of how it is sent and received. The dynamism required us to update our codebase to DotNET 4.x since DotNET Standard 2.0 did not have the C# features I needed. 
</p>
<p>
   As I started implementing this I encountered a few issues. Firstly, Attributes did not work the way I had assumed they would and allow me to inject
code into a class. However, since we require all new messages to derive from AbstractMessage, I instead could move that code from an attribute into
AbstractMessage. The [NoNetSerialize] attribute can stay, because it is simply a marker which can be interrogated by Reflection FieldInfo.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, Reflection has negative performance implications, particularly when used in hot code paths. RavEngine uses variadic templates to generate the serialization code for each use
  at compile time which alleviates this issue, but based on my research C# does not have a similar mechanism both due to how C# works and how our code
  is structured. While the old hard-coded way was error-prone and fragile, it was fast because it was effectively hand-inlined. By contrast, all the 
  field enumerating requires many dynamic lookups. 
  I will need to profile this implementation to determine how much of a penalty Reflection causes, and based on this, how and if we need to revise the
  implementation. Currently the code is not ready so I can't conduct those tests yet.

  I also investigated switching our scripting backend from Mono to il2cpp. Mono is an open source implementation of the C# virtual machine which Unity uses. 
  Unfortunately it is quite slow, which is a problem for performance-sensitive code like a network backend. To rectify this problem, Unity developed
  il2cpp, which is a C# to C++ source transpiler. In games using it, the virtual machine is eliminated entirely and all code generation is native, leading
  to significant performance improvements. It is not as good as purpose-built C++, but in most game projects it is more than enough. However, it is not perfect
  and not all C# features are supported. 
</p>
<p>
  On our master branch without the new serialization system, il2cpp was able to compile the game without any in-game issues that I could find based on my testing. 
  I haven't been able to test this on the serializer branch because the code is not done yet.

  Project Skyscraper uses a relatively old version of Unity (2020). In more recent versions, Unity has been experimenting with switching from Mono to
  Microsoft's first-party DotNET Core CLR virtual machine, which has impressive near-native performance.
  While the work is not yet done, if it is successful, it might render il2cpp obsolete on some platforms. It gets more nebulous on non-PC targets,
  since iOS, Xbox, and potentially others do not allow executable memory, which fast VMs like CoreCLR rely on to implement hardware JIT compilation to
  achieve their impressive performance results.
