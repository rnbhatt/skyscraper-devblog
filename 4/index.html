<h2>Work this week</h2>
<h4>Disable Save System in Multiplayer</h4>
This was a longstanding issue on the Jira. In multiplayer, we do not want the save system to be active, because of balancing and complexity issues. 
For example, what would happen if you saved with one set of players, and then loaded with another? Fortunatley this was a fairly easy issue
to solve, I ended up just disabling the Save button in the pause menu if in a multiplayer game. There remain some UX issues like the fact that
save icons appear on Free Play modes when starting a multiplayer game, but I think these will be resolved when our designer completes their overhaul
of that screen.

<h4>Fix performance issue in game loop</h4>
<p>
Another programmer noticed while working on the game that when in multiplayer, later waves would lead to lag spikes and low frame rates, even 
on very powerful hardware. We pair-programmed to debug and resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
  We used Unity's profiler to detect where the slowdowns were coming from. In this case, it was the fault of a single script, GameLoopMessageSender.cs.
  In later waves, it was sometimes taking over 200ms per frame! Unfortunatley, Unity's profiler does not elaborate what specifically inside 
  that script was taking up all the time, but fortunatley, Unity offers a very easy API to emit custom profiler information in the graph. All one needs to do is
  surround the code they want to measure, like so:
</p>
<pre>
  Profiler.BeginSample("Name the block");
  // code to time goes here
  Profiler.EndSample();
</pre>
<p>
  which when run, will cause blocks to appear in the profiler which indicate how long those specific chunks of code took to execute. I placed 5 of these
  in GameLoopMessageSender.cs, around each of the major tasks it completed in Update. In the profiler, we saw that one of them was taking up
  all of the time. It was the part of the code responsible for sending the enemy death synchronization events. 
</p>
<p>
  The caused turned out to be a simple programming error that is easy to make. 
</p>
<pre>
for(int i = 0; i < deadEnemiesList.Count; ++i) {
    int id = deadEnemiesList[i];
    lobby.Send(new EnemyDespawnMessage(id));
    indicesToDelete.Add(i);
}
foreach(int i in indicesToDelete) {
    deadEnemiesList.Remove(i);
}
</pre>
<p>
  Do you see it? The first for loop adds indices to a list, and the second for loop uses those indices to remove items from a container. However, this code
  does not work as intended. When one calls Remove(i), the underlying container shifts elements, resulting in all future indices no longer matching.
  If Remove() is passed an index that doesn't exist, it silently fails. The result of this is that deadEnemiesList is not cleared each time
  the synchronization happens, so over time it slowly grows in size until the first for loop ends up taking hundreds of miliseconds to run. The fix was very
  simple - just call deadEnemiesList.Clear() instead of making another container and removing elements by index. The team member who wrote this 
  intended for the container to be cleared anyways.
</p>

<h4>Waiting Room</h4>
<p>
This task was the first major inter-disciplinary effort that I was part of during project Skyscraper. For all of my past tasks, I was creating 
APIs and dealing with backend internals, so I rarely interacted with the UI. In this case, I was tasked with implementing functionality for a work-in-progress 
waiting room UI. The purpose of this UI is to serve as a room for the host to invite a Steam friend to the game, configure difficulty options, 
and change avatars. Specifically, I took on implementing pop-up dialogs and the Steam Friends overlay.
</p>
<p>
Our designer worked on adding the art assets for each dialog. Since our designer (understandably) does not have much experience in Unity, I 
cleaned up the dialogs by ensuring they scaled properly and converted the static images into interactive button elements. I then wrote a 
generic script to drive dialogs.
</p>
<p>
The generic DialogBase class offers two API methods: Show and Dismiss. Show() enables the subobject which causes the dialog to appear on-screen and 
become interactive. Dismiss() disables the subobject so the dialog disappears and becomes non-interactive. The class also exposes two UnityEvents, one for
Confirm Pressed and the other for Cancel Pressed. This enables a client programmer to hook up their own functions to the dialog buttons easily, and 
make the dialogs do different things in different plaecs. When a button is pressed, the dialog also calls Dismiss() on itself automatically, which also
un-registers anything attached to either UnityEvent, making reuse cleaner. 
</p>
<p>
All dialogs except for the Invite Players dialog use DialogBase unmodified. In the case of Invite Players, it does not follow a simple Confirm-Cancel flow,
so I subclassed DialogBase to add custom behavior. When the "Confirm" button is pressed, I added the call to invoke the Steam Friends overlay. We don't want to
dismiss the dialog in this case because the player may want to summon that overlay again. At present, the call to display the Steam Friends overlay does
nothing, because we have not yet registered our game with Valve yet. We plan to submit a build to Valve next weekend.
