<h2>Work this week</h2>
<p>
My main task this week was to refactor the game's internals to support more than one player, and to study Valve's networking library. 
Before, Project Skyscraper assumed that there was only a single player and so took many shortcuts
such as the use of static singletons to store health. 
</p>

<p>
<h3>RPCs on Steam Networking</h3>
  My custom C++ game engine also uses Steam networking, though, 
  I use Valve's <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets">GameNetworkingSockets</a>, 
  which is a version of Steam Networking that has been separated from the rest of the Steam API. This serves
  as a useful testing ground since the API and usage patterns are the same across both SteamWorks and GameNetworkingSockets. 
  Though my engine implements a more generic networking solution, the overall architecture that I designed and refined this week is
  directly applicable to Project Skyscraper. 
</p>
<p>
  The architecture is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Byte 1: Command Code<br>
    This byte tells the recipient what type of message is represented. These values correspond to an enum. The bytes that follow depend on the message type. 
    In RavEngine, these values are Spawn, Destroy, RPC, OwnershipToThis, OwnershipRevoked, and ClientRequestingWorldSynchronization. Because Skyscraper does not use a 
    server-authoritative model, the header byes will have different meaning there. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Bytes 2-18<br>
    These bytes hold the entity UUID. In the case of ClientRequestingWorldSynchronization, these bytes are omitted. We decided to use C# GUIDs for Skyscraper, which are functionally identical to UUIDs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bytes 19-27
    These bytes store the name of the World in the case of ClientRequestingWorldSynchronization, Spawn, and Destroy. This data is
    required because RavEngine supports multiple active worlds at once. This is the only field that is not applicable to Skyscraper, because Unity does not support multiple disjointed active worlds. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Remaining bytes<br>
    These bytes store RPC payload. The fields are encoded as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 bytes: type CTTI<br>
        These bytes are a compiler-stable hash generated at compile time which allows the engine to store types in containers and send them over
        the network, something that is not otherwise possible in C++. The RPCUnpacker looks up the deserialize information based on this number when decoding fields.
        In Skyscraper, we will take advantage of the C# reflection capabilities, meaning we will not need an analogue to CTTI. 
      </li>
      <li>
        N bytes: Payload<br>
        The remaining bytes encode the data. Currently, my serialize and deserialize method is <code>memcpy</code>, which is not great. In Project Skyscraper,
        we use a more intelligent serialization and deserialization mechanism built in to C#. Note that there is a fancy-but-vulnerable serializer in C# which we
        will <u>not</u> be using in Skyscraper. Instead we are using the more basic one which functions similarly to RPCUnpacker, but with less memcpy. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
These messages are routed through a centralized dispatcher which uses the header data in the message to determine what to do with the messages, and then
route them to the proper recipient or object.
I had prototyped this design many months prior to Project Skyscraper, but I found many bugs and mistakes in my early design, and so
I spent some time this week fixing those. At present, the engine has successfully synchronized six clients, with each client owning
ten objects and updating their positions, which are then propagated to each other client. This proof-of-concept provides valuable information about the viability
and scalability of this networking architecture. Because I have proven that this method can work, it means we would be able to use it in Skyscraper.

<h3>Singleplayer Assumptions</h3>
A few rules change in multiplayer mode which necesitate core changes to the game. These are:
<ol>
  <li>
    Players can only sell towers that they own. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Resource rewards are duplicated to each player.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
This means that each machine must have a player ID associated with it, and towers must track which player is its owner. 
I started the refactor by changing the interface of PlayerResources to intead be an array of Resource objects instead of a 
global integer. The compiler helped me track down all of the places where behavior needed to change. 
</p>
<pre>
 public class Resource
    {
        int currency = 0;
        public int GetCurrency() { return currency; }
        public void SetCurrency(int newCurrency) { currency = newCurrency; }
        public void AddCurrency(int addCurrency) { currency += addCurrency; }
    };

    public Resource[] allResources = new Resource[2] { new Resource(), new Resource()};
</pre>
<p>
  I went with this approach instead of changing the Resources to not be a singleton because it requires the 
  fewest overal changes to the rest of the game. I then implemented the player ID system. I defined the host player to be
  player 0, and the client to be player 1. The system should be flexible enough to handle more than 1 client, though
  we currently are not planning on supporting that. However, for testing purposes, it was important for us to be able to change 
  the local machine's player ID for testing purposes. I added a companion devconsole command SetPlayerNumber which enables changing the player number. 
  In SteamLobby, I leveraged C# getters to enable automatically updating the player ID when join statuses change:
</p>
<pre>
 public enum LobbyPosition
    {
        HOST = 1,
        JOINER = 2,
    }
    private int playerNumber = 0;               // do not access this directly!!
    private LobbyPosition _impl_lobbyPosition = LobbyPosition.JOINER;  // do not access this directly!!
    private LobbyPosition lobbyPosition
    {
        get => _impl_lobbyPosition; 
        set
        {
            _impl_lobbyPosition = value;
            playerNumber = Convert.ToInt32(value) - 1;
        }
    }

    [Obsolete("!!!!! Do not use this directly !!!!!")]
    public bool SetPlayerNumber(int newNum)
    {
        switch (newNum)
        {
            case 0:
                lobbyPosition = LobbyPosition.HOST;
                return true;
            case 1:
                lobbyPosition = LobbyPosition.JOINER;
                 return true;
            default:
                Debug.LogError("Invalid number!");
                return false;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
It is important that other programmers do not cache player IDs, because that would cause strange bugs when testing using the command. I added some 
convenient helper methods which allow easily getting the local machine's Resources, ID, and other information. These methods
all respond to changes to the player ID. If other programmers use these features, then we should not encounter any issues with player IDs. The Obsolete
  decorator causes a warning to appear in the editor, to discourage their use outside of the specific places where I needed to use them to implement
  the feature.

<h3>Other Contributions</h3>
<p>
As part of my initial onboarding, I added a command to set the player's health. Very simple. I also added some
  utility shell scripts which create symbolic links of the project so that one can easily and quickly open multiple Unity instances for testing
  multiplayer. 
</p>
<h3>Goals for Next Week</h3>
  I will most likely join the efforts to implement a messaging system using the prototype I had created for my engine.
