<h2>Work this week</h2>
<h3>Serialization fixes</h3>
<p>
	We encountered a critical issue with the reflection-based serialization system I created earlier this semester when trying to make builds.
The game worked perfectly in-editor, but in built, none of the messages worked! When we investigated this issue, we discovered that all of the serializer
classes and message types were gone from the build! The root cause for this turned out to be pretty simple. I was using reflection to query the environment
  at runtime to generate data structures of our different serialization classes. However, I never explicitly referenced these classes anywhere in the code, they
  more or less existed in a little pocket dimension until the reflection system could access them. This meant that when creating builds, the deadstripper would
  delete all of our serialization classes. Then when the game booted up, the reflection system would find no types and our data structures would be empty, resulting
  in all of the netcode breaking. 
</p>
<p>
  Our programming lead quickly made a hack to get around this so that our Industry Playtesters could actually run the build. He created the UselessCommand, a devconsole class which
  explicitly called every serializer method and default constructor on empty data so that all of the code had a "usage" and would not be deleted from
  the build. This solution solved the immediate problem, and isolated the hack to a single location, but it re-introduced all of the error-prone manual entry that I was trying to avoid when I created our 
  Reflection-based API in the first place. After doing some research, I came across [Preserve], an annotation developers can add to methods and classes which signals to the
  deadstripper that it should not strip them, even if the item does not have any explicit references. I had to manually add this annotation to every Message default constructor, and every 
  static method of every Serializer class. Once I did this, I was able to remove the UselessCommand from the game. It's still error-prone to have to add [Preserve] to all of these
  things in order to make the build work, and the game can fail in erratic ways if [Preserve] is not included in every required place. I think while this reflection-based API is 
  very clean and simple from a client-programmer perspective, if I had to do it again, I would probably not use reflection.

<h3>High GPU Usage</h3>
I noticed that our game used 100% of my laptop's GPU and drained the battery quite quickly. I looked through
our project settings and noticed that we had a lot of graphics presets that we didn't appear to use anywhere, and some of them had vsync disabled. I removed all of them except
one, and enabled vsync on that setting. Despite this, in built, the game still used 100% of my laptop's GPU. We didn't have a frame rate display anywhere in the game so I wasn't
sure if the high GPU usage was due to an uncapped frame rate or expensive visual effects. I added a debug overlay which can be toggled via the F3 key and displays the current
frame rate, active GPU, resolution, and information about the render pipeline. This debug overlay showed me that the game was trying to render over 1,000 frames per second 
on my laptop, which is odd because I explicitly enabled vsync in the projects settings. I then tested the game on macOS (I was previously using the Windows partition on my laptop) and the vsync worked fine, capping the frame rate to 60.
More confused, I found a CAEN machine running Windows and tested the game there, and the vsync worked correctly there too. I tried both the Nvidia and Intel GPU on the CAEN
machine and in both cases the frame rate was correctly capped to 60. My laptop has an AMD GPU, so I think that the issue is actually a bug in either AMD's Windows driver or Unity's
interaction with AMD's driver that is causing it to not respect vsync. I wasn't able to test it on a different AMD device unfortunately, so I just left the issue where it was,
since the frame rate seemed to now be correctly capped on most hardware. 

<h3>Bug Fix Bonanza</h3>
With only a week left before the showcase, the game still had many gamebreaking issues which we simply could not ship. Unfortunately I and many others on the team had to
exceed our hour limits to get the game over the finish line. A subset of the issues we fixed:
<ul>
  <li>Starting Gold too low on Hard difficulty, making it impossible to buy any towers</li>
  <li>Difficulty was not getting correctly synchronized to the client</li>
  <li>Tower costs became desynchronized as more games were played</li>
  <li>Multiplayer UI appearing in singleplayer</li>
  <li>No way to create private (friends-only) lobbies</li>
  <li>Exiting the game does not destroy the lobby, leading to lobby breakages later in-game</li>
  <li>If either player quit the game, the game would continue but in a bugged state for the other player insead of exiting to the main menu</li>
  <li>Impossible for the user to know who owns what room in the room browser</li>
  <li>Player names were not appearing in lobbies or in-game</li>
  <li>"Join game" from the Steam overlay did not work</li>
  <li>Leftover debugging "host" and "join" buttons in the singleplayer menu</li>
  <li>Game was using Uncompressed PCM for audio, making the install size 10x larger than it needed to be</li>
  <li>macOS build always failed to initialize Steam API</li>
</ul>

I'll highlight a couple of the issues here:
<p>
<b>macOS build always failed to initialize Steam API</b><br>
When looking through the error log, I discovered that the Steam client library was not able to load the Steam dylib. This happened because of macOS's strict security requirements.
Our game needed to have Hardened Runtime enabled so that the OS would even launch it, but one of the side effects of this is that by default an application with Hardened Runtime
  cannot load any code that was not codesigned with the same ID as the application. Our mac build was codesigned with my ID, but the Steam dylib was signed with Valve's ID, so the
  OS did not permit us to load it. Fortunately, we can enable exceptions to the security rules in the Hardened Runtime options in Xcode. I tried enabling "Disable Library Validation" 
  which stated that it disabled the same-signature requirement but that didn't fix the error. I enabled all of the runtime security exceptions and with that the macOS build
  was able to initialize Steam. I didn't have time to figure out which combination of settings actually fixed it so I just left it like that. This is still not any less secure
	than the Windows or Linux versions of the game, because those operating systems allow all of these permissions for all programs by default.

<p>
  <b>Tower costs became desynchronized as more games were played</b><br>
  The previous developers used Unity Scriptable Objects to define how tower costs changed based on the difficulty of the game, which worked well then. However, when we 
  added multiplayer, we added a cost scalar so that the game would not be too easy with two players. Unfortunately, we discovered one of the footguns with Scriptable Objects. 
  We applied the multipler to the scriptable object directly, thinking that it would get reset when we reloaded the level. But not only are Scriptable Objects global statics, but
  they persist changes <i>between game runs in the editor</i> and they save their state changes to the Asset file on disk! Global, mutable, persistant state. 
  This caused the multipliers to stack between games, which caused the tower prices to increase with each game played, and we spent a long time confused about why
  the values in the scriptable object were not getting reset when we stopped and restarted the game in-editor. Only when we closed Unity and git-reset our changes did we
  discover why this was happening. Our quick fix was to make an in-memory copy of the scriptable object and write the changes to the copy instead, meaning that any changes would get flushed when a new level was loaded. It makes sense from a techincal perspective
  why Scriptable Objects work like this, but from a user perspective it is absolutely bewildering. If I were designing scriptable objects, 
  I would only allow modification from the Editor and not from game code, so that it wouldn't be possible to make this mistake. There might be valid uses for the mutable-persistantness 
  of it, but I don't think it is worth the time wasted tracking down changes to global state.

Ragnarok TD is also WolverineSoft's first game to natively support Linux! No Proton involved! I was amazed at how easy it was. All I had to do was
add the toolchain package, change the target to Linux when building, and
add a depot + launch config for it on Steam. It basically 'just worked' from there. I didn't have to use a Linux system at all aside from to test it, since one can cross-compile to 
Linux from a Windows or macOS build machine.
